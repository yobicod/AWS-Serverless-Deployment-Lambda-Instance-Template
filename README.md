# AWS Lambda Deployment with Networking Infrastructure

This CloudFormation script facilitates the deployment of a Lambda instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) alongside essential networking infrastructure components such as a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), subnets, NAT Gateway, and route tables.

## Description

The CloudFormation script includes the following resources:

- **YourVPC**: Defines a VPC with the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16` for isolated networking.
- **PublicSubnet**: A public subnet (`10.0.1.0/24`) within the VPC that allows instances to have public IP addresses (`MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true`).
- **InternetGateway**: An Internet Gateway to enable internet connectivity for resources within the VPC.
- **AttachGateway**: Attachment of the Internet Gateway to the VPC for public subnet internet access.
- **PrivateSubnet**: A private subnet (`10.0.2.0/24`) within the VPC that restricts direct access to the internet.
- **NatGateway**: A NAT Gateway associated with the public subnet (`PublicSubnet`) to allow instances in the private subnet to access the internet securely.
- **PrivateRouteTable**: Route table for the private subnet to control traffic flow within the VPC.
- **PublicRouteTable**: Route table for the public subnet to direct outbound traffic.

The script configures routing tables (`PublicRoute` and `PrivateRoute`) to manage traffic, directing internet-bound traffic through the NAT Gateway for instances in the private subnet and enabling direct internet access for instances in the public subnet.

## Usage

1. Copy the CloudFormation script provided above into a `.yaml` or `.yml` file.
2. Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or other AWS SDKs to deploy the stack.
3. Monitor the CloudFormation deployment for successful creation of networking infrastructure and Lambda deployment.

Ensure to replace `"your-eip-allocation-id"` with the actual Elastic IP (EIP) allocation ID associated with your NAT Gateway before deploying the stack.

This CloudFormation template provides a foundational setup for deploying a Lambda instance in AWS while configuring necessary networking components for secure and controlled access.
